Welcome to the Computational Model for Axial Grooved Heat-pipes!


INSTRUCTIONS:

- The uploaded files are Maple files and can be accessed using Maple software only.


INPUT:

- Default values for all the geometric and thermo-physical properties of the said solid-liquid pairs are added to the codes, please feel free to alter the geometric properties as per your convenience.
- Altering the thermo-physical properties of the fluids may result in errorsome outputs due to the changes in Poiseuill√©s Number.



OUTPUT:

- The models generate values of Maximum Heat Transfer (Q_Max) and Effective Thermal Resistence (R_th) for a given heat-pipe.

- The Plots of several thermo-physical properties of the working-fluid are also generated with respect to the location in the axial direction.
